# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Brief explanation of the feature.

# Basic example
[example]: #example

If the proposal involves a new or changed API, include a basic code example.
Omit this section if it's not applicable.

# Motivation
[example]: #motiviation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted,
the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words,
enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
closely to the solution you have in mind.

# Detailed explanation
[explanation]: #explanation

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the proposal in enough detail for somebody
familiar with PSF to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

As a rule of thumb, explain your proposal as if you were teaching it to another
team member. That generally means:

- Introducing you proposal
- Using examples to explain your suggestion
- Explaining the impact of your suggestion as concretely as possible
- Clarifying its relation to our existing views
- Clarifying how the suggestion would be applied

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space
- the impact on teaching people PSF
- integration of this feature with other existing and planned features

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

What other solutions have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?
Why is this suggestion the best in the space of possible similar suggestions? 

# Adoption strategy
[adoption]: #adoption

If we implement this proposal, how will existing PSF developers adopt it? Is
this a breaking change? Can we write a codemod? Should we coordinate with
other projects or libraries, e.g. CIoT IaaS team or Smartlife?

# How we teach this
[adoption]: #adoption
What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this
idea best presented? As a continuation of existing Pario patterns?

Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the Pario documentation must be
re-organized or altered?

How should this feature be taught to existing Pario developers?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities, e.g. CIoT have done here?
- For community proposals: Is this view supported by some other community and what were their experiences with it?

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the
lessons from other people, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us
whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other communities/teams.

Note that while precedent set by other communities/teams/companies is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate an RFC.
Please also take into consideration that Pario sometimes intentionally diverges
from other parties.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Optional, but usually recommended as a chance to elaborate on the impact briefly outlined above.

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would
be and how it would affect the team and its interaction with other parties as a
whole in a holistic way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible
interactions in your proposal.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the
RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section
is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be
in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs.
The section merely provides additional information.
